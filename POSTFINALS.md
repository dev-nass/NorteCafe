# Panel Suggestions
Here are the panels suggestions during the supposedly 45mins presentation that turned into an almost 3hrs one.
[x] Customers should able to view the menu, but still disable the add to cart button if they are not considered as verified user.
[x] All order cancellation should should at least show an alert that will include an input element that they can type in the reason for their cancellation, before sending that another alert should show to "are you sure you wan to cancel?".
[x] Visible spinning loader for email sending
[x] Cancellation on *Admin* and *Staff* side should include the name of who cancel it. (needs double checking)
[ ] On employee and rider side registration, the email should already be free-filled because we are sending that form to them through email.

[ ] If a transaction is cancelled it can still be access using this
http://localhost/PHP%202025/Norte%20Cafe/public/index.php/transaction-pending-show-admin?id=102
[x] Explore the admin side for tomorrow and view some things to improve their too.
[x] Archive table for Add ons since we added status.

# Issues:
[ ] Discount doesn't have archive functionality, it only has complete deletion.
